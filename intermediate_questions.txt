-What is the purpose of the 'break' statement in a loop? | Exit the program. | Skip the current iteration and move to the next one. | End the loop and continue with the next statement after the loop. | Restart the loop from the beginning. | 2
-In object-oriented programming, what is encapsulation? | Combining different data types into a single variable. | Restricting access to the internal details of an object. | Creating multiple instances of a class. | Connecting objects in a network. | 1
-What is the purpose of the 'super' keyword in Java? | Refer to the superclass of the current class. | Indicate a method is superior to others. | Start a new thread. | Execute a superclass constructor. | 0
-What is the purpose of cache memory in a computer? | Store permanent data. | Provide additional RAM. | Improve memory access times. | Execute high-level programming languages. | 2
-What is Little Endian and Big Endian? | Types of memory units. | Sorting algorithms. | Data storage byte order. | CPU architectures. | 3
-What is the purpose of the 'Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)' in a CPU? | Execute instructions. | Store data and instructions. | Perform mathematical operations. | Manage input and output devices. | 2
-What is the purpose of mathematical induction in discrete mathematics? | To prove statements for specific cases. | To disprove statements. | To prove statements for all positive integers. | To perform mathematical operations. | 2
-What is the difference between a permutation and a combination? | Permutation involves repetition, while combination does not. | Permutation is the arrangement of elements, while combination is the selection of elements. | Permutation has a specific order, while combination does not. | Permutation and combination are the same thing. | 1
-What is the principle of inclusion-exclusion in combinatorics? | A technique for solving linear equations. | A method for counting overlapping elements in sets. | The process of finding the greatest common divisor. | A rule for multiplying probabilities. | 2
-What is the purpose of the 'continue' statement in a loop? | Skip the rest of the code in the loop and move to the next iteration. | End the loop and proceed with the next statement after the loop. | Restart the loop from the beginning. | Exit the program. | 0
-In relational databases, what is normalization? | A process of organizing data to minimize redundancy. | Sorting data in ascending order. | Adding new records to a table. | Creating indexes for faster data retrieval. | 0
-What is the difference between a function and a method in programming? | There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable. | A function is a standalone block of code, while a method is part of a class or object. | A method is a standalone block of code, while a function is part of a class or object. | Functions are used in procedural programming, while methods are used in object-oriented programming. | 1
